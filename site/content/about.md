North Star AI is a technical hands-on conference focusing on machine learning. We bring together developers, tech leads, data analysts, technical founders and anybody else who wants to learn about technical aspects of AI.

North Star AI is all about quality and focus on the exchange of real-life experiences and case studies from practitioner to practitioner.  We welcome participants who want to be up to date with the code and move ahead as we are here to learn and network.

For the first time on March 8th, 2018 North Star AI brings to Tallinn great international speakers and hundreds of curious professionals who are all passionate about ML, AI and data science.  This is a unique opportunity to tap into the leading minds of AI technology here in Estonia, the most advanced digital society in the world and network with experienced data scientists, engineers, analysts, and techies.
